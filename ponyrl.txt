★ Pony Rogue-like thingy ★
==========================

Technical
- C
- Multiplatform
- 16c, 88c, 256c console, top-down tiles
  - Let's focus on 256c for now
  - We can probably assume unicode though, at this point
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_code
  - http://man.cx/ioctl(2) http://man.cx/tty(4) particularily ioctl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, &sz)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGWINCH

Overarching themes
- Replayability.
- You don't save the world, Celestia does not return. You did your best! Bittersweet

Classes / Balancing
- Ponies
- Pegasus, Unicorn, Earth
- Extremely Rare alicorn transformation.
- Transform into other races, really rare / polymorphy. Every race should be polymorphable to, with various advantages and drawbacks.
- Fatigue as so called 'mana'
- Magic takes a lot of Fatigue / Unicorns have lot fatigue
- Unicorns low HP
- Unicorns are physically weak but end up having powerful magic later on to make up for it: typical wizard class.
- Pegasi… what about them? Somewhat strong but not very tough? Also they can FLY!
- Earth ponies are fucking tanks.

Items
- Magical artifact thingies
- Magical scrolls
- Awesome random gennerated item drops.
- Inventory / Hammerspace / Sadlebags
- Random Enchanting both can be good or bad / Expencive
- Identifing items mechanic. No (or few) identification scrolls, players should instead rely on topical books : specific, much less convenient to carry, but infinite uses, and you can probably find a few in towns.

Gameplay
- On armoured enemies you can get stuck, If you have spiked horseshoes that are nailed to your hoof, and suffer a critical miss
- Turn based
- Random genned world with a few fixed spots
- No classes, just races, like a multiclass/free system
- Opening your inv makes you unable to do anything else
- Friendly NPC's / shops and such
- NPC Companions FO Style. Can level on some form, to combat abandoning of companions. Avoid OP!
- RAD text descriptions
- Char creation should be very basic, gender name tribe/breed, fast from start to play as we can. Also random name generator.
- Dialog should not interfere with gameplay. NPCs say things into the log, and you get a reminder to press a key to reply. You can ignore them if you like.
- Map : Big fat map of doom? (Cataclysm style… well, many-modern-games style) Smaller connected maps? (FO style) Former makes the player feel more free, latter is much easier to achieve and allows for convenient fast-travel mechanics. Not sure if we want those though.
- Tile elevation? Would make for some fun line-of-sight hyjinks. We can use all them colours to make it look good. How do we handle overlapping?
- Possible overlapping can be handled by "blend" zones and smooth transitioning between "slices" of map. For big overlaps?

⚠ map format brain dump below ⚠ warning: confusing and confused
If we have a huge map, we're going to need to split it into smaller (say, 256x256) tiles and either:
  1) store all of them in the savefile, lots of shit to save
  2) make our map generator deterministic so we can regenerate it whenever reentering a tile
making it deterministic /and/ believable is not easy, each tile should ideally depend on tiles around it
we can generate some half-believable terrain with a few passes of perlin noise, but then we need to place map features
To make rivers and lakes and other bodies of water, we can throw water on the whole map, make it roll downhill and erode terrain (lower elevation a bit for every square where it passed, neighbouring squares as well maybe, dump it all where it stopped), leave water where it is, after a few (hundred) passes, we'll have some nice lakes and river channels… empty river channels. Maybe keep track of where the most water passed and just put perma-flowy water there?
The main problem with this ^ is that we can't run it everytime we load a tile. It is much too slow. We can:
  1) Do it once when starting the game and store it all, but that's not very elegant, or
  2) Make a low res map when starting the game, taking note of which tiles have cities, caves, streams passing through them and in which direction, etc. Store that, and generate the tile deterministically taking that into account. Sounds a bit iffy to do well.
Once we have water, we can start placing towns close to water and other profitable venues (mines? forests? fertile soil?? more stuff we need to place), and linking them with a network of roads.
Another thing to consider is changes to the map, how do we store them? If you blow up a wall, leave, come back and the wall is there again, it kind of ruins the realism. Even tiny things like "what is inside this closet" should be considered. We could save an overlay of changed spaces, it would be much less costly than SAVING EVERYTHING.
Back to overlapping, if we want a cave in a cliff, we're going to need squares for the inside of the cave, and squares for the ground at the top of the cliff. Since everything is connected and in the same array, those squares would have the same coordinates. We need to cut the world into horizontal slices ~2m high. This way we can have caves with normal ground over them, twisty 3D mazes, or even look out from atop a tower and see much farther. Also flight for flight-enabled races would make some sort of sense. However, this implies heavier memory usage, since we have to keep the tiles above and below us in memory as well— a volume instead of an area. We have to be extra careful not to load useless tiles.

Elevation on squares is 0-8, added to the slice's height.
I imagine a slice to be about 2.5m high.


MAP GLOSSARY because I'm getting confused by my very own vocabulary
- Slice: Huge array of tiles, all around the same elevation.
- Tile: 256x256 array of squares. Seamlessly link with neighbouring tiles, they shouldn't be obvious to the player. Only a few of these should be loaded in memory during normal gameplay.
- Square: one character on the screen, can contain (one creature and items on the floor) or one entity, has a terrain type and, if applicable, an elevation value.
- Terrain type: determines what a square does and looks like. has attributes (passable, hurts...), a character or a range of characters, and a single colour and a range of background colours for shading and variety. e.g. grass, rock, rock wall...
- Entity: nonliving, immutable thing that you can interact with in a variety of ways. They have a character and a colour. The background colour of the underlying terrain type should be visible. e.g. doors, windows, store shelves...

Story / Setting
- Story based
- Not just one bad guy
- 1-200 years after exile of Luna
- Cultists of some sort as the evil force.
- Location is offmap from both comic and walmart, making the map very randomized and replayable.
- parts of the story can be switched around based on randomizing and to a lesser extent choice (Or indeed, skipped completely?)
- "like, you're supposed to go to town X to do whatever but instead you wander around and just trip on the next part of the story" -codl 2013 represent yo
- Celestia is withdrawn, still in control, but slowly becoming a faceless ruler.
- The cultists feel threatened by this and try to establish their own ruling over the land, a supposed democracy among the top leaders of the cult ultimately following one entity within the cult. A faux democracy.
- Ponies forget, as generations pass with Celestias reclusiveness, ponies become less happy, and the cultists more powerful, more aggressive. ??? moar

- Why, how: Player:
- Player comes to the town, seeking out adventure/justice/???

IDEA SPAM BELOW

==Technical things
blabla we said C or C++ can't be bothered to scroll up and copypaste
16:07:24 <Scootaloo> also it should be
16:07:29 <Scootaloo> multi-platform

==Races, classes, balancing, all that shizzle
15:56:10 <Vivix> I say pone, for fun-
15:56:29 <Vivix> I mean, that would give magic, strength and flying uses, you know? That could be interesting gameplay
15:57:11 <Vivix> cause yeah a fun thing iin nethack was--tunneling making holes in floors
15:57:15 <Vivix> a pegasus could fly up-
15:57:35 <Vivix> aaa VERY powerful unicorn could teleport
15:57:54 <Vivix> but yeah try to base magic and stuff on pony, not dnd or something

16:10:24 <Vivix> well my favourite things from nethack was being able to break walls and floors- and write in the dust to remind myself where I am
16:11:27 <Vivix> and I'm sure earthpony and unicorn could break doors etc in different ways

16:24:39 <Vivex> should we allow alicorns?
16:24:59 <codl> not as starting characters
16:25:21 <codl> but there should be a way to magic yourself into an alicorn
16:25:35 <codl> extreme blessing for being super cool or whatever
16:25:38 <Vivex> yeah, like a magic well or osmething?
16:25:41 <Scootaloo> well
16:25:48 <Scootaloo> alicorn should be really dificult to get atleast
16:26:16 <codl> like, get all the 150 puzzle pieces
16:26:28 <codl> that don't even show up on the map you have to examine every space
16:26:33 <codl> something crazy like that
16:26:57 <Vivex> but yeah DIFFICULT
16:27:05 <codl> or maybe not that crazy, it would be fun if you could get it by an extreme stroke of luck

16:34:20 <Vivex> but yeah unicorns seem to have REALLY low mana
16:34:26 <Vivex> I mean Twilight get's tired really fast
16:35:03 <Vivex> Like, twilights machine gun lazer really didn't do much more than stun- but eh
16:35:23 <Vivex> we know they can hurt ponies, Trixie was getting more and more crazy right? And her last spell she said was going to make them writhe in agony and pain

16:37:21 <Scootaloo> but unicorns should be way weaker HP wise as well :U

16:37:31 <Vivex> I think the show has nerfed them enough for them to be balanced easily
16:37:37 <Vivex> cause yeah HP, fatigue, mana

18:40:36 <codl> oh! do we allow other races as a starting race
18:40:47 <codl> like griffins and… maybe not dragons
18:40:58 <Vivex> known civilized species, yeah
18:40:59 <codl> dragons would just breeze through
18:42:09 <codl> different playing style
18:42:22 <codl> different items they can use
18:42:41 <Vivex> talons!
18:42:55 <Vivex> but yeah that could also increase playability, different styles and solutions
18:43:58 <Vivex> maybe not goats etc, since they couldn't speak in the show etc
18:44:00 <Vivex> not sure about minotaurs
18:44:32 <Vivex> I mean they are discord spawn, they might be more feral and more likely to be enemies of ponies
18:44:38 <Vivex> like kiinda dragons might be,
18:44:43 <Vivex> griffins might be--mixed

18:46:20 <codl> we can have only ponies as a starting race, and have some sort of polymorphy
18:47:05 <codl> like really hard to find polymorphy potions
18:47:21 <Vivex> those could be in place of unlockable etc yeah
18:48:37 <Vivex> well acting as a unlockable, like a bonus that can be found

===Items? not sure if I should make a section for those yet
16:36:35 <codl> we'd need magical artifact thingies
16:36:44 <codl> or no-one will want to play anything but unicorns

17:36:13 <codl> do we want to rely on items a lot?
17:36:17 <codl> most roguelikes do that
17:36:37 <codl> but I'm not sure if it would work that well here… how does a pony fire a bow
17:36:59 <codl> well
17:37:52 <codl> in nethack for example, after a few floors, you can't rely on hitting things until they die, you have to use items to avoid or kill monsters
17:38:07 <Vivex> well do want cool loot, but weapons and etc will be made for ponies, or maybe a few excoting griffin ones you cna use with varying ability
17:39:40 <Vivex> well bow could be more like a magic item or-- a complex/different crossbowy thing of earthpony design
17:39:54 <Vivex> you know, we have to compensate a lot that way, which would make cool new item types
17:41:02 <Vivex> but yeah I think we might want to make it a bit like that on the later levels, hack and slash would be difficult
17:42:03 <Vivex> even earth ponies would probably have a bit of a problem trying to make mouth-wielded swords fast, but hooked horseshoes or something-
17:45:08 <Vivex> oh man, on armored enemies, a tiny chance of getting stuck on your enemy if you have a critical miss

18:08:29 <codl> inventory
18:08:33 <codl> should be hammerspace
18:08:50 <codl> or, you should have a tiny hammerspace inventory
18:09:01 <codl> and you can have idunno saddlebags
18:09:12 <Vivex> yeah- saddlebags that increase the space?
18:09:15 <codl> yeah
18:09:27 <Vivex> but yeah hammerspacy, not that fun with loot if you can only carry one weapon and a flask

18:21:10 <Scootaloo> Also.. enchanting?
18:21:21 <Scootaloo> with both good and bad chances
18:21:36 <Scootaloo> So it's a gamble but it still costs stuff
18:21:54 <Scootaloo> enchanting found items
18:22:00 <Scootaloo> and obviously finding as well I guess?
18:22:01 <Scootaloo> rarely
18:22:51 <Vivex> cause yeah we've seen various enchantments
18:23:18 <codl> it would have to really cost a lot
18:23:34 <Scootaloo> Yeah, it would cost a lot, and it's really a gamble because it can be good or bad
18:24:22 <Vivex> I mean we've seen a feeew enchantments in the show, like sombra etc
18:25:39 <Vivex> I can't remember any items themselves, but I think enchanting yourself should be reallyy hard-
18:25:47 <Vivex> only seen it from the princesses, twilight, and sombra I thiiink?
18:26:16 <Scootaloo> that's why it will cost
18:26:22 <Scootaloo> it won't be easy to enchant

18:23:48 <codl> when you find items they aren't identified
18:24:07 <codl> just "iron sword"
18:24:20 <codl> not "+1 iron sword or coolness also it recieves radio"

18:52:39 <Vivex> but yeah I just kinda want to avoid unlockables in the main menu
18:53:10 <Vivex> have it a bit more like- the old days like "Oh if you recognize this room, break a hole in that wall, and you might find this"

LELE SCROLLS
14:44:42 <codl> magic for the masses
14:44:59 <codl> but yeah one-time use
14:44:57 <Vivix> Well, we could certainly do that and use the time period and dark period as an excuse
14:45:41 <codl> but… why wouldn't they still be in use today
14:46:19 <Vivix> maybe they're a bit dangerous, and maybe considered a bit hostile?
14:46:28 <Vivix> You know, something ponies had in the war, etc?
14:47:02 <codl> so they just fell out of use
14:47:12 <codl> because they're basically guns
14:47:27 <codl> and no-one's comfortable with using them
14:47:40 <Vivix> like the risk is too much
14:47:45 <Vivix> and earth ponies seem a bit anti magic any way
14:48:39 <Vivix> and yeah there's no scrolls in the Trixie intro, so we're on edge of canon, but I think our excuses and gemaply is good enouh excuse

==General gameplay
blabla turn based gameplay too much to quote
16:21:30 <codl> they're just very short turns I guess
16:21:53 <codl> some actions could take more than one turn tho
16:22:54 <Vivex> and some spells will probably take more than turn

16:27:23 <Scootaloo> random gen worlds
16:27:32 <Vivex> yeah, rogue gen etc
16:27:39 <Vivex> maybe a few non-random locations but in random positions?
16:29:16 <codl> story-relevant nonrandom places

16:30:10 <Vivex> and yeah, cool text descriptions would be nice
16:30:15 <Vivex> look at's etc

16:38:56 <codl> fatigue/mana
16:39:02 <codl> is there a difference
16:39:07 <Vivex> I'm not sure-
16:39:18 <Vivex> I mean, we've seen twilight get physically tired from using a lot of magic-
16:39:21 <Vivex> so they're at least related
16:40:42 <codl> I think we might as well just make it fatigue
16:40:45 <codl> simpler is better
16:40:59 <Scootaloo> everyone gets fatigue

16:42:59 <Vivex> have we ever seen swords and stuff?
16:43:48 <Vivex> cause I guess unicorn wielded swords would be different-
16:43:57 <Vivex> but I still kinda want earth ponie and pegasi to be able to use them

16:43:46 <Scootaloo> also
16:43:49 <Scootaloo> what classes?
16:43:59 <Vivex> classes? Hm
16:44:13 <Vivex> Class system would have to be related to breed type
16:44:22 <codl> do we need classes?
16:44:30 <Vivex> not sure, we could just do a classless system
16:44:31 <Scootaloo> mhm that's a good one
16:44:39 <Vivex> where you just kinda- increase the skills you use the most
16:45:02 <Vivex> the breed type take care a lot of the standard classes
16:46:53 <Vivex> a class system on top of that might just feel limiting, you know? They all just have the default skills
16:47:02 <Vivex> like a multiclass/free system like many WRPGS

17:50:50 <Vivex> oh and char creation, even if it isn't visible or useful, just you know- for fun
17:51:05 <Vivex> like some text adventures have fakechoices, just to make you feel immersed
17:51:50 <Scootaloo> well if we go graphs it would be visual i suppose
17:52:00 <codl> lotsa choices
17:52:05 <codl> dunno which ones matter
17:52:15 <codl> so you start taking them all seriously
17:52:58 <Vivex> like not so many choices you get stuck all day, but just enough to make you feel--like you are more like your char

17:54:53 <Vivex> and yeah if graphics, the basic like- mane colour etc would be visible
17:55:01 <Vivex> though then there would be a lot of armor stuff- but yeah worry about that later

8:12:15 <Vivex> one thing I think would be fun to avoid is typical--constraints
18:12:27 <Vivex> like, maybe able to carry a saddlebag in your muzzle, occupying it, etc
18:12:45 <codl> but then it restricts what you can do
18:12:51 <Vivex> hehe, yeah like- yeah it has drawbacks
18:12:57 <Vivex> but if you found biitchin loot you just want to get out alive with
18:13:03 <Vivex> it's possible, instead of impossible

19:15:39 <Vivex> would there be any friendly npcs?
19:15:44 <Vivex> diablo had some I think- for selling loot
19:15:47 <codl> well sure, in towns                       
19:15:57 <Vivex> yeah- but only towns?
19:16:03 <codl> shopkeepers, enchanters, what have you
19:16:21 <Vivex> maybe a creepy zebra in the forest who sells you potions if you've helped her once

19:16:29 <codl> we could have quests where you have A PARTNER OMG
19:16:46 <codl> or hire a goon
19:16:53 <Vivex> FO1 COMPANION STYLE
19:20:58 <codl> PETS!

==Setting, story
16:51:26 <Vivex> you thinking eh premodern ponyday? Like-
16:51:33 <Vivex> before the show so to speak?
16:52:11 <Vivex> but yeah it kinda needs a villain aand--
16:52:16 <Vivex> a conflict
16:52:21 <Vivex> not just LOOT
16:52:40 <codl> preferably a conflict that would bring some variety
16:52:49 <codl> not just lel changelings all game
16:53:19 <Vivex> and changelings are more cavedwelling than dungeondwelling it seems (comics at least)
16:53:29 <Vivex> evil unicorn might be too simple-
16:54:15 <Vivex> Diablo had several bosses, right?
16:54:41 <Vivex> then it could be like a cult or something
16:54:48 <Vivex> variety in races and types of enemies
16:54:53 <codl> lots of tiny quests that fit into the main quest
16:56:05 <Vivex> that sounds like it could add some story depth too, not ONE evil guy, you know?
16:56:12 <Vivex> agendas etc
16:56:26 <Scootaloo> because ONE EVIL OVERLORD is clichee
16:56:38 <codl> you could be done with one group and "BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE"
16:56:53 <codl> and suddenly you realize that this is muuuch bigger than you thought

16:59:04 <Vivex> but yeah how are you thinking the maps with that kind of idea?
16:59:15 <Vivex> like nethack all underground or- like diabloe mostly underground but some not?
17:00:13 <codl> I was thinking something more like ADOM
17:00:19 <codl> one huuuge outside map
17:00:35 <codl> and dungeons and caves and towns and what have you

17:02:14 <Vivex> but yeah then we can have it pre-show ages, maybe not super long ago, but- can't meat the mane six etc
17:02:15 <Vivex> meet*
17:03:00 <Vivex> maaybe..maybe a few hundred years after Luna's exile, whilst Celestia had a loose grip of the world
17:03:08 <Vivex> not discord crazy, but still tumultous

17:35:00 <Vivex> even small short descriptions every now and again make it feel bigger

18:37:52 <Vivex> well we could look at the maps from walmart and the maps from the comic and try to like see any cool places?
